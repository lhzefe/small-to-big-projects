## About

This is a repository that contains a series of projects for programming language practice, to be used as a model or just as a reference.

The projects found here were made by me, but have been proposed by various authors who have been cited in addition to the project name in the [list of projects](#list-of-projects).

## Getting Started

The projects are categorised by level of difficulty, but you have to bear in mind it's a feeling, and remember that sometimes what is easy for one person is not easy for others. With all of this in mind, I hope you have fun and learn a lot through these **Small to Big Projects**.
